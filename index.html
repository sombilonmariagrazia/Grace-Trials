    <p>-Sa Dulo ng Pahina-Sa unang sulyap sa 'yong mukha ay alam ko agad
Na kailangan ng pamagat ng gagawin nating kwento
Sa bawat ngiti ng 'yong mata ay nahulog ako
Sa mundong umiikot sa 'yo na para bang walang ibang tao
Sana'y samahan mo akong kulayan
Ang kulay abo kong mundo kung saan
Ikaw lamang ang kulang, hindi magkukulang
Ang pagmamahal ko sa 'yo

Sana'y ikaw at ako
Sa dulo ng pahina ng aking libro
Kasama kang maglalakbay sa bawat yugto
Ng kwentong sinusulat ko
Mapapangako sa 'yo
Walang hanggang pagmamahal ibibigay ko
Hanggang sa pagtanda aalalay sa 'yo
Magtiwala ka lang mahal ko

Sa bawat saya mong dala
Napapatanong na ako
Kung totoo bang lahat ng ito
'Di lang mapaniwalang pinili ako

Na makasama mong sabay kulayan
Ang kulay abo kong mundo kung saan
Tayo lamang ang kulang hindi magkukulang
Ang pagmamahal ko sa 'yo

Sana'y ikaw at ako
Sa dulo ng pahina ng aking libro
Kasama kang maglalakbay sa bawat yugto
Ng kwentong sinusulat ko
Mapapangako sa 'yo
Walang hanggang pagmamahal ibibigay ko
Hanggang sa pagtanda aalalay sa 'yo
Magtiwala ka lang mahal ko

Kay tagal hinintay ang araw na 'to
Na makita kang naglalakad at patungo
Ng altar dala ang ating pangako
Na tayo hanggang dulo

Alam kong ikaw at ako
Sa dulo ng pahina ng ating libro
Kasama kang maglalakbay sa bawat yugto
Ng kwentong sinusulat ko
Mapapangako sa 'yo
Walang hanggang pagmamahal ibibigay ko
Hanggang sa pagtanda aalalay sa 'yo
Marinig ko lang sagot mong oo.

-Napapangiti na naman ako - Nakatingin (nakatingin) sa salamin (oh)
Ang dami nang nagbago sa 'kin (sa 'kin)
'Di na gano'n kabigat (bigat)
Tumama na ang lahat (lahat)
Nakahanap na ng katapat, whoa
'Di ko inakala na may makikilala (ooh)
Sa 'di inaasahang pagkakataon (ooh)
Napapangiti na naman ako
At ikaw ang dahilan nito
Bumabalik ang kulay ng aking mundo
Napapangiti na naman ako (oh)

At ikaw ang dahilan nito
Bumabalik ang kulay ng aking mundo
Napapangiti na naman ako, oh
Minsan na rin akong sumuko (ooh)
Sa lungkot din ako'y nalunod (oh)
Kalimutan ang nakaraan
Mayro'n nang bagong dahilan
Habang-buhay kang sasamahan, whoa
'Di ko inakala na may makikilala (ooh)

- Maliwanag mong Mundo- "Dito ko lang ah
Oo naman, hindi ako aalis"

Ilang beses nang hinanap ang liwanag sa gabing walang buwan
Nagbabakasakali na mahanap ang isang bituin na gagabay
Sa madilim kong mundo

Biglang nakita ka
Sa 'di inaasahang pagkakataon
Ilaw ng 'yong ganda
Nahahalina pwede bang sa 'yo ako

Ayokong umasa
Na ikaw na
Sapat na ang sayang dala, sigla sa buhay ko
O aking prinsesa
Dinggin mo sana
Hiling ko na hagkan ako
Dalhin mo na 'ko sa maliwanag mong mundo

Ilang oras nang naghahanap ng masisilungan
'Pagkat umuulan
Malabo ang tingin, hirap sa paghinga ito'y bitin
Sumasabay sa pag-iyak ng mundo

Biglang nakita ka
Kung sa'n tanggap ko na na mag-isa ako
Payong mo na dala
Pwede ba ako dyan sa kanlungan mo

Ayokong umasa
Na ikaw na
Sapat na ang sayang dala, sigla sa buhay ko
O aking prinsesa
Dinggin mo sana
Hiling ko na hagkan ako
Dalhin mo na 'ko sa maliwanag mong mundo

Ayokong umasa

-Ginintuang Tanawin- Napapaisip sa gitna ng kaguluhan
Litong-lito sa pulso ng nararamdaman
'Di mawari kung ito'y 'sang panaginip
Tila ang puso ko'y naglalaro sa kalawakan
Sa liwanag ng araw, ika'y nariyan
Magkatabi't sinisilayan ka
'Di na alam, naguguluhan
Tuwing kasama kita sa
Ginintuang tanawin sa ilalim ng langit
Ika'y kapiling ko
Sa pag-ihip ng hangin, kasabay ng awitin
Ramdam ang palad mo
Sana'y dinggin ang dalangin, ang aking hangaring
Mahalin mo rin ako
Kulay kahel na langit, nakitang gumuhit
Sa ganda ng mata mo
Sumisilip ang tinatagong kagustuhan
Makasama ka't manatili sana sa 'yong tabi
Umaawit sa kislap ng 'yong mga ngiti
Hihiling na lang na sana'y ako man lang ay 'yong tignan
Sa liwanag ng araw, ika'y nariyan
Magkatabi't sinisilayan ka
'Di na alam, naguguluhan
Tuwing kasama kita sa
Ginintuang tanawin sa ilalim ng langit
Ika'y kapiling ko
Sa pag-ihip ng hangin, kasabay ng awitin
Ramdam ang palad mo
Sana'y dinggin ang dalangin, ang aking hangaring
Mahalin mo rin ako
Kulay kahel na langit, nakitang gumuhit
Sa ganda ng mata-
Nagtatanong ang aking isipan
Nais mo rin ba akong mahagkan?
Hanggang dito na lang ba
Ang ating pagkakaibigan?
Ginintuang tanawin sa ilalim ng langit
Sana'y malaman mo
Sa pag-ihip ng hangin, kasabay ng awitin
Ramdam mo ba ako?
Sana'y dinggin ang dalangin, ang aking hangaring
Mahalin mo rin ako
Kulay kahel na langit, hindi mapipilit
Mabigyan ng pag-ibig mo.

- My Favorite Movie - It's Saturday, I'm all alone
I'm stuck inside my trailer home
And all I could think of is how you doin'
Going places I don't know
Interviews and TV shows
But I just wanna pack my things and just get goin'
'Cause all I want is you
Behind the cameras, I see you
You know it's only you and me
And no one else will ever be
The leading lady in this story
That will always be
My favorite movie
My favorite movie, yeah
It's 2 a.m., and you're still on my mind
I'm wishing you're here by my side tonight
Missing you in every mornin'
I can't wait to leave this place
'Cause nothing beats your sweet embrace
'Cause there's no better song than hearing your heart beating
'Cause all I want is you
Behind the cameras I see you
You know it's only you and me
And no one else will ever be
The leading lady in this story
That will always be
My favorite movie
My favorite movie
You know it's only you and me
And no one else will ever be
The leading lady in this story
That will always be
My favorite movie
My favorite movie
My favorite scene is a night full of romance
As I take you to the dance
With you there'll never be a second glance
To get down on my knees and take my chance
You know it 'cause it's you
Behind the cameras I see you
You know it's only you and me
And no one else will ever be
The leading lady in this story
That will always be
My favorite movie
My favorite movie
(Oh, 'cause this is our love story)
You know it's only you and me
And no one else will ever be
The leading lady in this story
That will always be
My favorite movie.

-Say You Wont let Go - I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, "I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest"
I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night, yeah
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow
I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most
I'm gonna love you 'til my lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part, like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me 'til we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go.

- I Love You Too Much - I love you too much
To live without you loving me back
I love you too much
Heaven's my witness and this is a fact
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much
I live for your touch
I whisper your name night after night
I love you too much
There's only one feeling and I know it's right
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much
Heaven knows your name, I've been praying
To have you come here by my side
Without you, a part of me's missing
Just to make you my home, I will fight
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much
I love you too much
I love you too much
Heaven's my witness and this is a fact
You live in my soul
Your heart is my goal
There's love above love and it's mine 'cause I love you
There's love above love and it's yours 'cause I love you
There's love above love and it's ours
If you love me as much.

-I Love You Too Much - Baby, take my hand
I want you to be my husband
'Cause you're my Iron Man
And I love you 3000
Baby, take a chance
'Cause I want this to be something
Straight out of a Hollywood movie
I see you standing there
In your Hulk outerwear
And all I can think
Is where is the ring
'Cause I know you wanna ask
Scared the moment will pass
I can see it in your eyes
Just take me by surprise
And all my friends they tell me they see
You planning to get on one knee
But I want it to be out of the blue
So make sure I have no clue
When you ask
Baby, take my hand
I want you to be my husband
'Cause you're my Iron Man
And I love you 3000
Baby, take a chance
'Cause I want this to be something
Straight out of a Hollywood movie
Now we're having dinner
And baby you're my winner
I see the way you smile
You're thinking about the aisle
You reach in your pocket
Emotion unlocking
And before you could ask
I answer too fast
And all my friends they tell me they see
You planning to get on one knee
So now I can't stop thinking about you
I figured out all the clues
So now I ask
Baby, take my hand
I want you to be my husband
'Cause you're my Iron Man
And I love you 3000
Baby, take a chance

-Perfect - I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Oh, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
No, no, no
Mm, oh
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person, and she looks perfect
Though I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight.

-Beautiful In White -Not sure if you know this
But when we first met
I got so nervous I couldn't speak

In that very moment
I found the one and
My life had found its missing piece

So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now to my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight

What we have is timeless
My love is endless
And with this ring I say to the world

You're my every reason
You're all that I believe in
With all my heart I mean every word

So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now to my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight

You look so beautiful in white
So beautiful in white
Tonight

And if our daughter's what our future holds
I hope she has your eyes
Finds love like you and I did
But when she falls in love we'll let her go
I'll walk her down the aisle
She'll look so beautiful in white

You look so beautiful in white

So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now to my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight

You look so beautiful in white
Tonight.

-Grow Old With You -I wanna make you smile whenever you're sad
Carry you around when your arthritis is bad
Oh, all I wanna do is grow old with you
I'll get your medicine when your tummy aches
Build you a fire if the furnace breaks
Oh, it could be so nice growing old with you
I'll miss you, kiss you
Give you my coat when you are cold
Need you, feed you
Even let you hold the remote control
So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink
Put you to bed when you've had too much to drink
Oh, I could be the man who grows old with you.

-Marry Your Daughter - Sir, I'm a bit nervous
'Bout being here today
Still not real sure of what I'm going to say
So bare with me please
If I take up too much of your time
But you see, in this box is a ring for your oldest
She's my everything and all that I know is
It would be such a relief if I knew that we were on the same side
'Cause very soon I'm hoping that I
Can marry your daughter
And make her my wife
I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life
And give her the best of me 'til the day that I die, yeah
I'm gonna marry your princess
And make her my queen
She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen
I can't wait to smile
As she walks down the aisle
On the arm of her father
On the day that I marry your daughter
She's been hear every step since the day that we met
(I'm scared to death to think of what would happen if she ever left)
So don't you ever worry about me ever treating her bad, no
We've got most of our vows done so far (so bring on the better or worse)
And 'til death do us part
There's no doubt in my mind
It's time
I'm ready to start
I swear to you with all of my heart
I'm gonna marry your daughter
And make her my wife
I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life
And give her the best of me 'til the day that I die, oh
I'm gonna marry your princess
And make her my queen
She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen
I can't wait to smile
As she walks down the aisle
On the arm of her father
On the day that I marry your daughter
I'm gonna marry your daughter
And make her my wife
I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life
And give her the best of me 'til the day that I die.

-Blue- Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars
I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
You'd be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?
Know you're all that I want this life

I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing
I'll tell you I love you more
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you

I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

- Two Steps Behind - Walk away if you want to
It's okay if you need to
Well you can run but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all
Whatever you do, I'll be two steps behind you
Wherever you go, and I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around, I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, yeah
Take the time to think about it
Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around, you'll see what you can find
Like the fire that's burnin' up inside me
And there's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all, no
Whatever you do, I'll be two steps behind you
Wherever you go, and I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around, I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
There's a magic running through your soul
But you, you can't have it all
Whatever you do, I'll be two steps behind you
Wherever you go, and I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around, I'll be two steps behind
Yeah baby, two steps behind
Oh sugar, two steps behind.

-To The Bone - Have I ever told you
I want you to the bone?
Have I ever called you
When you are all alone?
And if I ever forget
To tell you how I feel
Listen to me now, babe
I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone
Oh-oh-ooh-ooh
I want you to the bone
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Maybe if you can see
What I feel through my bone
Every corner in me
There's your presence that grown
Maybe I nurture it more
By saying how I feel
But I did mean it before
I want you to the bone
I want you to
Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I'm rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, you call and
I'll take control your body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Would that be alright?
Hey, would that be alright?
I want you to the bone
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
So bad, I can't breathe
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
I want you to the bone
Of all the ones that begged to stay
I'm still longing for you
Of all the ones that cried their way
I'm still waiting on you
Maybe we seek for something that
We couldn't ever have
Maybe we choose the only love
We know we won't accept
Or maybe we're taking all the risks
For something that is real
'Cause maybe the greatest love of all
Is who the eyes can't see, yeah
Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I'm rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too, for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, I call and
I'll take control your body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours, oh-oh-ooh
Oh, yeah
(Would you just take me home?)
(Would you just love me long?)
(Or should I keep holding on?)
(Should I keep hoping on?)
(Could I just take you home?)
(Could I just love you long?)
(Or should I keep holding on?)
(Should I keep hoping on?)
I want you to the bone, yeah, yeay
I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone, yeah
I want you to the bone, bone, bone, oh
I want you to the bone.

-Those Eyes- When we're out in a crowd laughing loud
And nobody knows why
When we're lost at a club, getting drunk
And you give me that smile
Going home in the back of a car
And your hand touches mine
When we're done making love
And you look up and give me those eyes
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
When you call me at night while you're out
Getting high with your friends (high with your friends)
Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said
(You've ever said)
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
When we're done making love
And you look up and give me those eyes
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
All the small things you do.

-18 - I got a heart, and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms
Are made for holding you, oh-oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
We took a chance, God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh love
And let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms
Are made for holding you, oh, whoa
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
When we were 18
Oh Lord, when we were 18
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms
Are made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18.

-I Wanna Be Yours - I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Let me be your 'leccy meter
And I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
(Wanna be yours)
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (wanna be yours)
Breathin' in your dust (wanna be yours)
I wanna be your Ford Cortina (wanna be yours)
I will never rust (wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (wanna be yours).

-Tahanan- Sa araw-araw
Tanging ikaw ang palagi kong hinahangad
Laging tanaw
Sa 'yo ang ilaw na nagsisilbi kong liwanag
Labis ang ngiti kapag ika'y kaharap
Ramdam ko ang pagmamahal, giliw
Namumukod-tangi ka at walang katulad
Ikaw lang ang para sa 'kin
Sa 'yo lang, sa 'yo lang ako uuwi
Kaya naman
Dito ka sa piling ko
Oh, dito ka lang, dito ka lang
Bumabagal ang ikot ng mundo
Kapag ika'y nariyan, oh, aking tahanan
Ta, ta-ta-ta-ta, tahanan
Dito ka lang, dito ka lang, dito ka lang
Oh, aking tahanan
Sa bawat sandali
Na tayo ay magkayakap nang mahigpit
Taglay mong init
Ang bumabalot sa 'king nilalamig na damdamin
Tayong dalawa'y pinagtagpo
Ng tamang pagkakataon
Hindi maitatanggi
Na sa akin, ikaw ang tanging tiyak, ah
Ikaw lang, ikaw lang ang tinatangi
(Ikaw lamang ang tinatangi ko)
Ikaw lang at ako ang naaaninag (naaaninag)
Sa gitna ng paraiso na ating sinimulan
Oh, aking tahanan
Pinapawi lahat ng iyong mga ngiti
Negatibo na nakadikit sa 'king labi
Huli ng iyong ngiti ang aking kiliti
Katotohanan na hindi ko maitatanggi
Na mahal kita, walang iba
Kaya naman
Dito ka sa piling ko
Oh, dito ka lang, dito ka lang
Bumabagal ang ikot ng mundo
Kapag ika'y nariyan, oh, aking tahanan
Ta, ta-ta-ta-ta, tahanan
Dito ka lang, dito ka lang, dito ka lang
Dito ka sa piling ko
(Pinapawi lahat ng iyong mga ngiti)
(Negatibo na nakadikit sa 'king labi)
Bumabagal ang ikot ng mundo
(Huli ng iyong ngiti ang aking kiliti)
(Katotohanan na hindi ko maitatanggi)
Ta, ta-ta-ta-ta, tahanan
Dito ka lang, dito ka lang, dito ka lang
Oh, aking tahanan.

-Mahika- Nagbabadya ang hangin na nakapalibot sa 'kin
Tila mayro'ng pahiwatig, ako'y nananabik
'Di naman napilitan, kusa na lang naramdaman
Ang 'di inaasahang pag-ugnay ng kalawakan
Ibon sa paligid, umaawit-awit
Natutulala sa nakakaakit-akit mong tinatangi
Napapangiti mo ang aking puso
Giliw, 'di mapigil ang bugso ng damdamin ko
Mukhang mapapaamin mo, amin mo, oh
Giliw, nagpapahiwatig na sa 'yo
Ang damdamin kong napagtanto na gusto kita
(Gustong-gusto kita, giliw)
Hindi ko alam kung saan ko sisimulan (sisimulan)
Binibigyang-kulay ang larawan na para bang
Ikaw ang nag-iisang bituin, nagsisilbing buwan na kapiling mo
Sa likod ng mga ulap, ang "tayo" lamang ang tanging magaganap
Ibon sa paligid, umaawit-awit
Natutulala sa nakakaakit-akit mong tinatangi
Napapangiti mo ang aking puso
Giliw, 'di mapigil ang bugso ng damdamin ko
Mukhang mapapaamin mo, amin mo, oh
Giliw, nagpapahiwatig na sa 'yo
Ang damdamin kong napagtanto na gusto kita
Gusto kita, gusto kita
Gusto kita, gusto kita
Ano'ng salamangkang mayro'n ka? (Gusto kita, gusto kita)
Binabalot ka ng mahika (gusto kita, gusto kita)
Ano'ng salamangkang mayro'n ka? (Gusto kita, gusto kita)
Ako'y nabihag mo na, ah
(Na, nabihag mo na)
(Na, nabihag mo na)
Ako na nga'y nabihag mo na
Nang 'di naman talaga sinasadya
'Pagkat itinakda yata tayo para sa isa't isa
Giliw, nagpapahiwatig na sa 'yo
Ang da-da-da-damdamin ko
Da-da-ra-da, da-damdamin ko
Giliw, giliw
Giliw, napagtanto na gusto kita.

- Araw-araw - Umaga na sa ating duyan
'Wag nang mawawala
Umaga na sa ating duyan
Magmamahal, oh, mahiwaga
Matang magkakilala
Sa unang pagtagpo
Paano dahan-dahang
Sinuyo ang puso?
Kay tagal ko nang nag-iisa
And'yan ka lang pala
Mahiwaga
Pipiliin ka sa araw-araw
Mahiwaga
Ang nadarama sa 'yo'y malinaw
Higit pa sa ligaya
Hatid sa damdamin
Lahat naunawaan
Sa lalim ng tingin
Mahiwaga
Pipiliin ka sa araw-araw
Mahiwaga
Ang nadarama sa 'yo'y malinaw
Sa minsang pagbali ng hangin
Hinila patungo sa akin
Tanging ika'y iibiging wagas at buo
Payapa sa yakap ng iyong hiwaga
Payapa sa yakap ng iyong...
Mahiwaga
Pipiliin ka sa araw-araw
Mahiwaga
Ang nadarama sa 'yo'y malinaw
Mahiwaga
'Wag nang mawala araw-araw
Mahiwaga
Pipiliin ka araw-araw. Kung ito na ang huling minuto sa mundo
Mga segundo'y uubusin sa tabi mo
Kulang ang habang-buhay sa 'tin
Bitin ang habang-buhay sa akin
At kung ipipinta ko ang pag-ibig sa 'yo
Ito ay kulay na hindi pa nakita ng mata mo
Tila magbibilang ng hangin
Balor mo'y 'di kayang sukatin
Kahit lahat ay mawala na
Handa akong masaktan
Kung kapalit nama'y malaya
Kang mahahagkan (oh-eh-oh, oh-oh)
Tunay na propesiya
Ikaw ang dakilang rason ba't ako ginawa
Aking oksihina
'Pag hindi na makahinga (hindi na makahinga)
Kung ipahihiram ko nang isang araw ang mata ko
Malalaman mong sapiro ang tingin ko sa 'yo
Ika'y hiyas para sa akin (hiyas para sa akin)
Depekto'y 'di kayang hanapin
'Di kailangan ng dahilan para ika'y mahalin
Hanggang sa mawalan ng pandama
Ating palad na magkakilala
'Di ko alintanang
Kahit lahat ay mawala na
Handa akong masaktan
Kung kapalit nama'y malaya
Kang mahahagkan (oh-eh-oh, oh-oh)
Tunay na propesiya
Ikaw ang dakilang rason ba't ako ginawa
Aking oksihina
'Pag hindi na makahinga
Hak ìshum nghi kháw akì
Hak ìshum nghi kháw akì (oh-yeah)
Hak ìshum nghi kháw akì
Alh adngom ag ahwì
Al awa wa mhid ni hya gi nith

Kahit lahat ay mawala na
Handa akong masaktan
Kung kapalit nama'y malaya
Kang mahahagkan
Tunay na propesiya
Ikaw ang dakilang rason ba't ako ginawa
Aking oksihina
'Pag hindi na makahinga.
I LOVE YOU DADA ---
